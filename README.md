# PlayChain deployment

This repo contains useful scripts to deploy node in open PlayChain infrastructure.

What is the **node** in PlayChain infrastructure?

PlayChain provides a platform to play the games for PLC and inherit blockchain structure with DPoS mining.
Thereby this infrastructure contains both *classical witness* nodes and *gambling* nodes.
So we expect anyone to run own node for any type. That's fine for decentralization and therefore for the PlayChain platform.

We provide the encouraging system for node holders both for gambling and for mining types.
And this repo will help any person (who has enough PLC assets) to launch personal node

Use [node-deploy.sh](./games/node-deploy.sh) script to become gambling node owner.
Read [node-deploy.md](./games/node-deploy.md) for deatails.
