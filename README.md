# PlayChain deployment

This repo contains useful scripts to deploy node in open PlayChain infrastructure.

What is the **node** in PlayChain infrastructure?

PlayChain provides a platform to play the games for PLC and inherit blockchain structure with DPoS mining.
Thereby this infrastructure contains both *classical witness* nodes and *game* nodes.
So we expect anyone to run own node for any type. That's fine for decentralization and therefore for the PlayChain platform.

We provide the [encouraging system](https://github.com/totalgames/playchain-docs/blob/master/en/playchain_affiliate_allocation.md) for node holders both for game and for mining types.
And this repo will help any person (who has enough PLC assets) to launch personal node

Use [node-deploy.sh](./games/node-deploy.sh) script to become game node owner.
Read [node-deploy.md](./games/node-deploy.md) for deatails.
